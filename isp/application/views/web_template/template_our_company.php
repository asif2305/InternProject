           Vertex3 Soft is a common brand (co-branding) used by two local Vertex3 Soft operators New Generation Graphics Limited (NGGL) and Bangladesh Internet Exchange Limited (BIEL). Both companies have separate independent of each other networks and each customer signs the contract (by signing a registration form) with both. In order to use the worldwide expertise and the latest technologies, maintain high quality standards for the service and customer care both companies joined a group of international telecommunication service providers - MULTINET GROUP, which operates next generation networks in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Due to this fact ISP was able to attract foreign financing for its development and created hundreds of work places. Vertex3 Soft started its operation in Dhaka, Bangladesh from October 2011. Currently, it covers major areas of Dhaka city including Uttara, Gulshan, Banani, Mohakhali, Dhanmondi, Motijheel & its surrounding areas where the internet penetration is at its maximum. Key specific brand attribute is high level of customer care and attractive prices. Thanks to it the brand enjoys popularity among its subscribers.
